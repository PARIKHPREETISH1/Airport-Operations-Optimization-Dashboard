# Airport Operations Optimization Dashboard

## Overview
This project focuses on building an interactive Tableau dashboard to analyze and optimize operations for the five busiest airports in the United States. Using historical flight performance data, the dashboard provides actionable insights to airport authorities and operations teams to improve efficiency, reduce delays, and enhance passenger satisfaction.

The analysis compares operational performance across 2023 and 2024, highlighting delay patterns, cancellations, passenger flow challenges, and airline specific inefficiencies.

## Business Objective
The primary objective of this project is to enable data driven decision making for airport operations by:

• Tracking and visualizing key airport and airline performance metrics  
• Identifying patterns in delays, cancellations, and diversions  
• Highlighting operational inefficiencies across airports, airlines, and time periods  
• Supporting operational optimization to improve efficiency and passenger experience  

---

## Vision
To empower airport authorities with actionable business intelligence that helps reduce operational disruptions, optimize resource allocation, and improve overall airport performance through interactive visual analytics.
